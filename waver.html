  <h1>Agreement to Receive Optional Text Messaging Service</h1>

  <p>The Human Services Agency (HSA) is the city agency in charge of CalFresh (Food Stamps), Medi-Cal and other services. HSA is testing a text message service that sends reminders of appointments, renewals, and other information to your cell phone.  These text messages are optional. You will continue to get notices by mail whether or not you choose to receive text messages.</p> 

<p>Text messaging is not confidential, so HSA cannot send you text messages without your permission.  Anyone who uses your cell phone or who has access to it might see the text messages.  Communication service providers used by you or HSA may also be able to see these messages.  In addition, text message charges may apply, depending on your text message plan.</p>

<p>By signing below, you give HSA permission to send you text messages about reminders for appointments, renewals, and other information.  You can stop this any time by texting STOP to any message or by calling (415) 558-1001.  If you stop the service you will still be sent mailed notices.</p>

<p>If your cell phone number changes or your phone is lost, please call us at (415) 558-1001.</p>


<p>YES, I would like to receive text messages from HSA.  I understand that this service is optional and that I can stop participating at any time.</p>
