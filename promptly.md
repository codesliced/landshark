#Promptly
###A new kind of reminder.

Promptly is a text messaging service offered by the Human Services Agency of San Francisco. If you are a client of CalFresh in San Francisco, you can sign up to receive text message reminders for quarterly reports (for now - we'll be expanding the service as fast as possible!).

Because HSA respects your privacy, we won't send text messages to you without your permission. By signing the wavier below, we can start sending you text messages! You can also download  a copy of the waiver if you want to keep it in your records.


##Waiver

Agreement to Receive Optional Text Messaging Service

The Human Services Agency (HSA) is the city agency in charge of CalFresh (food stamps), Medi-Cal and other services. It is testing a text message service that sends reminders of appointments, renewals, and other benefits information to your cell phone.  These text messages are optional. You will continue to get notices by mail whether or not you choose to receive text messages. 

Text messaging is not confidential, so HSA cannot send you text messages without your permission.  Anyone who uses your cell phone or who has access to it might see the text messages.  Communication service providers used by you or HSA may also be able to see these messages.  In addition, text message charges may apply, depending on your text message plan.

By signing below, you give HSA permission to send you text messages about reminders for appointment, renewals, and other benefits information.  You can stop this any time by texting STOP to any message or by calling (415) 558-1001. If you stop, then you will still be sent mailed notices.

If your cell phone number changes or your phone is lost, then please call us at (415) 558-1001.

YES, I would like to receive text messages from HSA.  I understand that this service is optional and that I can stop participating at any time.
